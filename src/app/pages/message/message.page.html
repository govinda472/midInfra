      <div class="founder-message">
        <p class="intro-text">
          We are a transportation and infrastructure operating company with access to capital, not just an investment fund.
        </p>
       
        <p class="main-text">
          Our capital is long-term and dedicated to North American transportation and infrastructure. We have substantial cash resources to invest in infrastructure companies that offer exceptional investment returns, organically or through acquisition.
        </p>

        <p class="main-text">
          Our founders are distinguished operators. They can envision and execute creative ideas for growth that may have been laying-in-wait. They are people with insight, understanding of capital markets, and wide-ranging operating experience to evaluate the potential of a growth opportunity, and see to the successful implementation of the ones with legs.
        </p>

        <p class="main-text">
          While no opportunity is too big or too small for us, we tend to concentrate on investments between $10 to $80 million of EBITDA. These opportunities may be investments that were too big for small companies but too small for larger organizations.
        </p>

        <p class="main-text">
          We have the capital, we execute, we get things done alongside you. But most importantly, we are men and women of our word. Handshakes and commitments mean that we mean what we say and we say what we mean.
        </p>

        <p class="main-text">
          We also feel strongly that as many employees as possible in an organization have equity in the enterprise, but they don't have to write a check to receive it unless they want to buy more. We believe widespread ownership is an important foundation to developing and sustaining a business plan that involves higher growth and profitability.
        </p>

        <p class="main-text">
          Everyone shares in success and easily communicates ideas up, down and sideways through an organization because we have a common goal. At the end of the day, we are all operating people. The right person has to be in the right place at the right time. Every time. Our boots have to be muddy.
        </p>

        <p class="main-text">
          This is why MidInfra is referred to in the investment community as the Next Generation of Infrastructure Investing. And the end result is simple: customers and partners trust us. And when that happens you can achieve anything.
